# AlgorithMe 

 :mag: 
_Project Description_
----------------------------------------
Intended for computer science students who want to practice algorithm problems, this is a networking web site that allows students to study, test themselves and track their progress. 
Our product allows lecturers to monitor students’ grades and progress. 

Projected benefits for the consumer - the student receives feedback when he submits a solution to the programming algorithm.

Projected benefits for the lecturer – the lecturer receives the student’s score when the student submits a solution.

 Project Goals
----------------------------------------
•	To enable the student to study algorithms in an efficient way.

•	To allow the student to observe test cases and learn from them.	

•	To provide feedback to the student on his code (complexity, accuracy etc.).

•	To allow the lecturer to monitor the student’s progress.


# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

## Learn More

You can learn more in the [Create React App documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/getting-started).
